# Hello

I'm Thomas Letherby, an Infrastructure Architect based in the US, and this is my playground, when time allows.

I'm documenting more about this and other things over at <https://xrs444.net>.



# Code correctness

For the repos that control my homelab, the code is rapidly changing as I add, remove, refactor and generally mess about with it, so don't expect to clone the repos and have everything run first time. Once I get the whole thing stable and Im happy with it, I may do a release, but I'm a long way off. 

# AI Usage

A lot of the code you see here is generated by ClaudeAI, and sometimes it even gets it right. Much as I'd like to craft every line of every file by hand my time is limited, and it is far more efficient for me to lean on Claude to assist in roughing stuff out, assisting with troubleshooting and doing the donkey work while I review the proposed changes and point it in the right direction.
